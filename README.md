# Lasermaze
The laser maze hosted by the 2026 class government was designed and coded for the 3/23/2024 PTA Spring fair laser maze. This was one of the biggest highlights of the event.

Here in this repository you will find the solidworks cad and 3d printing files for the laser mounts, which were specifically designed for our schoolâ€™s Mutli Purpose room where we had 60 lasers mounted.

You will also find the code for collision detection using the arduino IDE in which we used the analog pins from 4 arduinos along with light dependent resistors to detect breaks in the laser beam.

Lastly, we had a live broadcasting system coded in processing Java in which we were able to stream the inside of the maze to visitors outside as well as a live updating leaderboard managed by our operators!

The success of this maze was thanks to the collective support of many individuals in our school community, as well as Polymaker who sponsored our filament to make this event possible.
